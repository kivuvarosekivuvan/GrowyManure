# GrowyManure
This platform is designed to simplify the process of purchasing fertilizers for farmers. The primary goal of this project was to create a user-friendly and visually engaging user interface. It's a known fact that when a product is visually appealing to users, they're more likely to recommend it to others due to its efficiency and attractiveness.

Throughout this project, I applied my knowledge of design principles to strike the right balance. My aim was to make it appealing while keeping it clear and uncluttered. This ensured that the design not only caught users' attention but also provided a seamless experience.
